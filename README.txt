--Currency Converter--
This program is a simple currency converter that retrieves exchange rates from an API and converts the currency amount
entered by the user. It is built with Python's tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface for the program.

Dependencies:
The program requires the following libraries to be installed:

tkinter
ttk
requests
You can install these libraries using pip: pip install tkinter ttk requests

Usage:
To use the currency converter, simply run the program in your Python environment. A GUI window will appear with a dropdown
list of currencies to convert from, an input box for the amount to convert, and a button to initiate the conversion.

Once the user selects the currencies and enters the amount to be converted, the program retrieves the exchange rates
from an external API and displays the converted amount in a label.
